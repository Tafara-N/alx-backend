- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the `pycodestyle` style (version `2.5.*`)
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`
- All your modules should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
- All your functions should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'`)
- A documentation is not a simple word, it's a real sentence explaining whatâ€™s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
- All your functions and coroutines must be type-annotated.
